The petitioner (spouse<br>initiating the divorce) will need to provide the grounds for the divorce and any<br>requests for spousal support, child custody, and property division.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Serving the Petition<\/strong><br>Once the petition is filed, the respondent (other spouse) must be formally served with<br>the petition and given an opportunity to respond.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Response to the petition<\/strong><br>The respondent has a limited amount of time to respond to the petition. They can<br>either agree to the terms of the divorce or contest them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Temporary Orders<\/strong><br>If there are disputes over child custody, support, or property, the court may issue<br>temporary orders to govern these matters until the final divorce decree is issued.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Discovery<\/strong><br>Both spouses will need to disclose all assets, debts, and income. This process is<br>known as &#8216;discovery&#8217; and is designed to ensure that both parties have a complete<br>understanding of the financial situation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Negotiation and Mediation<\/strong><br>Once both parties have a full understanding of the financial situation, they will<br>engage in negotiation and mediation to try to settle any outstanding issues.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trial<\/strong><br>If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the case will go to trial. Both parties<br>will present their case, and the judge will make a final decision on any remaining<br>issues.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Divorce Decree<\/strong><br>Once all issues have been resolved, the judge will issue a divorce decree. This<br>document finalizes the divorce and sets forth the terms of the property division, child<br>custody, and support.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Appeals<\/strong><br>Either party may choose to appeal the divorce decree if they believe the judge made<br>a legal error.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that divorce proceedings can vary depending on the<br>jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> As initially mentioned, we always encourage the road to reconciliation, in the best interest of your child(ren).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nine steps to reconciliate\/ seperate\/ divorce Below are the nine steps we apply to help parents&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":238,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_kadence_starter_templates_imported_post":true,"_kad_post_transparent":"","_kad_post_title":"","_kad_post_layout":"","_kad_post_sidebar_id":"","_kad_post_content_style":"","_kad_post_vertical_padding":"","_kad_post_feature":"","_kad_post_feature_position":"","_kad_post_header":false,"_kad_post_footer":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[5],"tags":[14,15],"class_list":["post-55","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-your-rights","tag-difficult-situations","tag-rights"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/55","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=55"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/55\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":307,"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/55\/revisions\/307"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/238"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=55"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=55"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.childrenneedboth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=55"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

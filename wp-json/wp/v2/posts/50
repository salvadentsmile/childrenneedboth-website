Listen &#8216;actively&#8217;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When someone speaks to you, it is essential that you give them your full attention and actively listen to what<br>they have to say. This means avoiding distractions like phones or television. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask questions or clarify points if necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Understand Boundaries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every member of the family has their own boundaries that need to be respected. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important not to overstep these boundaries by being too intrusive or demanding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Share and accept responsibilities<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Families work best when everyone pitches in with household chores and other responsibilities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By sharing tasks, we show consideration for each other&#8217;s time and energy levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Avoid hurtful words:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During arguments or disagreements, it can be easy to lash out with hurtful words that we later regret saying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of attacking each other verbally, focus on finding solutions together while respecting each others&#8217; opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Making Time For Each Other<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world where everyone seems busy all the time; making an effort towards spending quality time with your loved ones goes a long way in showing how much you value them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Practice empathy &#8211; Put yourself in their shoes <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicing consideration within families leads towards healthier relationships, mutual respect &amp; understanding between members by prioritising one another&#8217;s well-being above individual wants, needs, or desires. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It requires empathy &#8211; putting oneself into another person\u2019s shoes &#8211; active listening skills ,understanding boundaries ,sharing responsibilities ,avoiding hurtful words during conflicts &amp; making conscious efforts towards spending quality time together as a unit!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Consideration is an essential aspect of any healthy and happy family relationship.

However, some families may struggle with absent parents, which can have negative impacts on children&#8217;s development. In this article, we will delve into why it is essential for society to prioritise and support families, particularly those with absent parents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research has shown that parental involvement has a significant impact on children&#8217;s academic achievement, behaviour, and social skills. Children with involved parents tend to have higher academic success, better school attendance, and fewer behavioural problems. Additionally, children with supportive parents have better emotional regulation skills and are more likely to develop healthy relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prioritise support for children with absent parents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not all families have the luxury of both parents being involved in their children&#8217;s lives. In many cases, parents may be absent due to various reasons, including work demands, divorce, or incarceration. Unfortunately, children who grow up without one or both parents may have a higher risk of negative outcomes, such as lower academic achievement, behavioural problems, and social isolation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is crucial for society to prioritise and support families, particularly those who may be struggling with absent parents, to ensure that children have the best chance at a successful future. This support can come in various forms, such as community programs that provide mentorship and support for children and families, parenting classes that teach parents how to be more involved and supportive, and policies that support work-life balance for working parents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Seek family therapy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One particularly effective approach is family therapy, which can help both parents and children cope with the challenges of parental absence. Family therapy is a form of counselling that involves all members of the family, with the goal of improving communication, understanding, and support among family members. Family therapy can help children and parents build stronger relationships, build resilience, and develop coping skills to deal with the challenges of parental absence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The importance of involved and supportive parents in children&#8217;s development based on research studies.

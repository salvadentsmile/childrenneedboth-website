For example, a study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>fathers who were involved in their children&#8217;s lives had children with better academic performance and fewer behavioural problems than those whose fathers were not involved. <\/p>\n<cite>Journal of Marriage and Family<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mothers, on the other hand, have been found to play a crucial role in their children&#8217;s emotional development, particularly in the formation of secure attachment bonds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Negative effects of absent parents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not having one or both parents present can lead to negative outcomes for children. For instance, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>children who grow up without a father are more likely to drop out of school, have behavioural problems, and face an increased risk of incarceration. Additionally, children who grow up without a mother have been found to experience higher rates of depression and anxiety.<\/p>\n<cite>National Bureau of Economic Research<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Two-Parent Households<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have shown that growing up with two involved parents leads to better outcomes for children. For example, a study published in the Journal of Family Psychology found that <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>children who lived with both biological parents had higher self-esteem, better social skills, and improved mental health compared to children who did not. <\/p>\n<cite>Journal of Family Psychology<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, a report by the National Fatherhood Initiative found that <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>children who grow up with involved fathers are more likely to have better educational outcomes and be more successful in their careers.<\/p>\n<cite>National Fatherhood Initiative<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Co-parenting after separation\/ divorce<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important for separated or divorced couples to prioritise co-parenting for their child&#8217;s well-being. This means working together to make decisions in the child&#8217;s best interest, maintaining open and respectful communication, and ensuring that both parents remain involved in the child&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research has shown that children who have positive relationships with both of their parents after a<br>divorce or separation have better outcomes in terms of emotional well-being and academic performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The role of BOTH parents is crucial<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, the role of parents in children&#8217;s development is crucial, and the absence of one or both parents can have negative effects on children&#8217;s academic, emotional, and behavioural outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important for all families, whether together or apart, to prioritise healthy relationships between both mother and father figures. This means ensuring that both parents remain involved in their child&#8217;s life, even if they are no longer together. By doing so, we can help ensure that children have the best chance at a healthy and successful future. Society should prioritise and support families to ensure that children grow up in an environment that promotes their well-being.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Children&#8217;s well-being is closely tied to the presence of involved and supportive parents.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nine steps to reconciliate/ seperate/ divorce</h2>



<p>Below are the nine steps we apply to help parents reconcile/ separate or divorce.  We always encourage the road to reconciliation, in the best interest of your child(ren).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image55_8bd7c3-2a size-full kb-image-is-ratio-size"><div class="kb-is-ratio-image kb-image-ratio-land32"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="612" height="406" src="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Divorce.jpg" alt="" class="kb-img wp-image-238" srcset="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Divorce.jpg 612w, https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Divorce-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></div><figcaption>Separation of wooden figure of divorce family with gavel on wooden table in courtroom.

<p>Process of married, separating parents.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Filing the Petition for Divorce</strong><br>The first step is to file a petition for divorce with the court. The petitioner (spouse<br>initiating the divorce) will need to provide the grounds for the divorce and any<br>requests for spousal support, child custody, and property division.</li>



<li><strong>Serving the Petition</strong><br>Once the petition is filed, the respondent (other spouse) must be formally served with<br>the petition and given an opportunity to respond.</li>



<li><strong>Response to the petition</strong><br>The respondent has a limited amount of time to respond to the petition. They can<br>either agree to the terms of the divorce or contest them.</li>



<li><strong>Temporary Orders</strong><br>If there are disputes over child custody, support, or property, the court may issue<br>temporary orders to govern these matters until the final divorce decree is issued.</li>



<li><strong>Discovery</strong><br>Both spouses will need to disclose all assets, debts, and income. This process is<br>known as &#8216;discovery&#8217; and is designed to ensure that both parties have a complete<br>understanding of the financial situation.</li>



<li><strong>Negotiation and Mediation</strong><br>Once both parties have a full understanding of the financial situation, they will<br>engage in negotiation and mediation to try to settle any outstanding issues.</li>



<li><strong>Trial</strong><br>If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the case will go to trial. Both parties<br>will present their case, and the judge will make a final decision on any remaining<br>issues.</li>



<li><strong>Divorce Decree</strong><br>Once all issues have been resolved, the judge will issue a divorce decree. This<br>document finalizes the divorce and sets forth the terms of the property division, child<br>custody, and support.</li>



<li><strong>Appeals</strong><br>Either party may choose to appeal the divorce decree if they believe the judge made<br>a legal error.</li>
</ol>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that divorce proceedings can vary depending on the<br>jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case.</p>



<p> As initially mentioned, we always encourage the road to reconciliation, in the best interest of your child(ren).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep Your Children Safe</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image54_77e353-c1 size-full kb-image-is-ratio-size"><div class="kb-is-ratio-image kb-image-ratio-land32"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/woman-in-black-hoodie-holding-black-smartphone.jpeg" alt="" class="kb-img wp-image-16"/></div></figure>



<p>In today’s digital world, it’s all too easy for children to come into contact with strangers online, and it’s important to ensure that our children understand the risks associated with this.<br><br><strong>Here are 5 simple tips that parents can use to help their children stay safe online:</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. No &#8216;Stranger&#8217; Friends Online</h2>



<p>It’s important to talk to your children about the dangers of speaking to strangers online and encourage them to be aware of who they are talking to. Reinforce the message that if someone online makes them feel uncomfortable or scared, they should tell you or another trusted adult immediately..</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Advise them to NEVER to give out personal info</h2>



<p>Advise your children to never give out personal information such as their address, phone number, or social media accounts to anyone online.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Build trust so they confide in you</h2>



<p>Remind your children that if someone online makes them feel uncomfortable or scared, they should tell you or another trusted adult immediately.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Warn about opening files from strangers</h2>



<p>Make sure your children understand the importance of not clicking on unknown links or downloading any files from people they don’t know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Remind them NEVER to meet stranger&#8230;</h2>



<p>Remind your children that they should never meet up with anyone they’ve met online, no matter how well they may know them. This could be a way for someone to gain access to their personal information.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion &#8211; Practice</h2>



<p>Parents can help children develop these skills by providing them with opportunities to practice. For example, parents can encourage children to practice their conversational skills by talking about their day with them or by engaging in conversations about current events or topics of interest.</p>



<p>Parents can also give children choices to help them practice making decisions, such as which activity to do or what to have for dinner. <br><br>In addition, parents can help children develop their critical thinking skills by asking open-ended questions or discussing solutions to problems with them.</p>



<p>They can also provide age-appropriate books or games that help children practice thinking logically or reasoning through problems. <br><br>Finally, parents can model good communication and decision-making skills for their children, so that they can learn by example.<br><br>By taking these steps, parents can ensure that their children stay safe online and develop the skills necessary to make good decisions.</p>

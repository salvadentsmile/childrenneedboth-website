<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. No &#8216;Stranger&#8217; Friends Online</h2>



<p>It’s important to talk to your children about the dangers of speaking to strangers online and encourage them to be aware of who they are talking to. Reinforce the message that if someone online makes them feel uncomfortable or scared, they should tell you or another trusted adult immediately..</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Advise them to NEVER to give out personal info</h2>



<p>Advise your children to never give out personal information such as their address, phone number, or social media accounts to anyone online.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Build trust so they confide in you</h2>



<p>Remind your children that if someone online makes them feel uncomfortable or scared, they should tell you or another trusted adult immediately.</p>

<p>They can also provide age-appropriate books or games that help children practice thinking logically or reasoning through problems. <br><br>Finally, parents can model good communication and decision-making skills for their children, so that they can learn by example.<br><br>By taking these steps, parents can ensure that their children stay safe online and develop the skills necessary to make good decisions.</p>

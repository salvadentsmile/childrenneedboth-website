										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Consideration is an essential aspect of any healthy and happy family relationship.</h2>



<p>In practical terms, consideration may involve simple acts such as listening attentively when someone<br>speaks to us or helping out with household chores without being asked. </p>



<p>It may also mean refraining from saying hurtful things during arguments or making compromises when conflicts arise.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Showing consideration requires <strong>empathy &#8211; the ability to put ourselves in another person&#8217;s shoes and<br>understand how they feel</strong>. Empathy allows us to respond appropriately to others&#8217; emotions by offering support or comfort when needed.</p>
<cite>Mr D P &#8211; Leader at CNB</cite></blockquote>



<p>When parents, whether together or apart, prioritise showing each other respect through acts of kindness and understanding instead of focusing solely on individual wants, needs, and desires; it leads them towards healthier<br>communication patterns which further strengthen their bond over time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image50_f34bf7-e3 size-full kb-image-is-ratio-size"><div class="kb-is-ratio-image kb-image-ratio-land43"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="467" height="467" src="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/about-img-3.jpg" alt="" class="kb-img wp-image-261" srcset="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/about-img-3.jpg 467w, https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/about-img-3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/about-img-3-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 specific ways in which consideration can be practiced:</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Listen &#8216;actively&#8217;</h2>



<p>When someone speaks to you, it is essential that you give them your full attention and actively listen to what<br>they have to say. This means avoiding distractions like phones or television. </p>



<p>Ask questions or clarify points if necessary.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Understand Boundaries</h2>



<p>Every member of the family has their own boundaries that need to be respected. </p>



<p>It is important not to overstep these boundaries by being too intrusive or demanding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Share and accept responsibilities</h2>



<p>Families work best when everyone pitches in with household chores and other responsibilities. </p>



<p>By sharing tasks, we show consideration for each other&#8217;s time and energy levels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Avoid hurtful words:</h2>



<p>During arguments or disagreements, it can be easy to lash out with hurtful words that we later regret saying.</p>



<p>Instead of attacking each other verbally, focus on finding solutions together while respecting each others&#8217; opinions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Making Time For Each Other</h2>



<p>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world where everyone seems busy all the time; making an effort towards spending quality time with your loved ones goes a long way in showing how much you value them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Practice empathy &#8211; Put yourself in their shoes </h2>



<p>Practicing consideration within families leads towards healthier relationships, mutual respect &amp; understanding between members by prioritising one another&#8217;s well-being above individual wants, needs, or desires. </p>



<p>It requires empathy &#8211; putting oneself into another person’s shoes &#8211; active listening skills ,understanding boundaries ,sharing responsibilities ,avoiding hurtful words during conflicts &amp; making conscious efforts towards spending quality time together as a unit!</p>

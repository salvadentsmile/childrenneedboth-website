<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The importance of involved and supportive parents in children&#8217;s development based on research studies.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="612" height="408" src="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bp-img-wellbeing.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-287" style="width:852px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bp-img-wellbeing.jpg 612w, https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bp-img-wellbeing-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A diverse group of multi-ethnic elementary age school children sit on the grass linking their arms playfully in the summer sunshine and smile as they look forward.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Children’s well-being is a top priority for any society, and research has shown that the presence of involved and supportive parents is crucial for children’s success. However, some families may struggle with absent parents, which can have negative impacts on children&#8217;s development. In this article, we will delve into why it is essential for society to prioritise and support families, particularly those with absent parents.</p>



<p>Research has shown that parental involvement has a significant impact on children&#8217;s academic achievement, behaviour, and social skills. Children with involved parents tend to have higher academic success, better school attendance, and fewer behavioural problems. Additionally, children with supportive parents have better emotional regulation skills and are more likely to develop healthy relationships.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prioritise support for children with absent parents</h2>



<p>However, not all families have the luxury of both parents being involved in their children&#8217;s lives. In many cases, parents may be absent due to various reasons, including work demands, divorce, or incarceration. Unfortunately, children who grow up without one or both parents may have a higher risk of negative outcomes, such as lower academic achievement, behavioural problems, and social isolation.</p>



<p>It is crucial for society to prioritise and support families, particularly those who may be struggling with absent parents, to ensure that children have the best chance at a successful future. This support can come in various forms, such as community programs that provide mentorship and support for children and families, parenting classes that teach parents how to be more involved and supportive, and policies that support work-life balance for working parents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Seek family therapy</h2>



<p>One particularly effective approach is family therapy, which can help both parents and children cope with the challenges of parental absence. Family therapy is a form of counselling that involves all members of the family, with the goal of improving communication, understanding, and support among family members. Family therapy can help children and parents build stronger relationships, build resilience, and develop coping skills to deal with the challenges of parental absence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Children&#8217;s well-being is closely tied to the presence of involved and supportive parents. Unfortunately, not all children have the privilege of growing up in households with both parents present. According to a study by the US Census Bureau, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>1 in 4 children in the United States grow up in a home without a father figure, and approximately 1 in 3 children live in a home without a biological father present. </p>
<cite>US Census Bureau</cite></blockquote>



<p>This highlights the importance of understanding the impact that absent parents can have on children&#8217;s development.</p>



<div class="wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column276_6f4af3-79"><div class="kt-inside-inner-col">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="612" height="408" src="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bp-img-coparenting1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-281" style="width:851px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bp-img-coparenting1-1.jpg 612w, https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bp-img-coparenting1-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Happy family time</figcaption></figure>
</div></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The role of fathers/ mothers in child development</h2>



<p>Research has shown that fathers/ mothers play unique roles in their children&#8217;s emotional and cognitive development. For example, a study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>fathers who were involved in their children&#8217;s lives had children with better academic performance and fewer behavioural problems than those whose fathers were not involved. </p>
<cite>Journal of Marriage and Family</cite></blockquote>



<p>Mothers, on the other hand, have been found to play a crucial role in their children&#8217;s emotional development, particularly in the formation of secure attachment bonds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Negative effects of absent parents</h2>



<p>Not having one or both parents present can lead to negative outcomes for children. For instance, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>children who grow up without a father are more likely to drop out of school, have behavioural problems, and face an increased risk of incarceration. Additionally, children who grow up without a mother have been found to experience higher rates of depression and anxiety.</p>
<cite>National Bureau of Economic Research</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of Two-Parent Households</h2>



<p>Studies have shown that growing up with two involved parents leads to better outcomes for children. For example, a study published in the Journal of Family Psychology found that </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>children who lived with both biological parents had higher self-esteem, better social skills, and improved mental health compared to children who did not. </p>
<cite>Journal of Family Psychology</cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Additionally, a report by the National Fatherhood Initiative found that </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>children who grow up with involved fathers are more likely to have better educational outcomes and be more successful in their careers.</p>
<cite>National Fatherhood Initiative</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Co-parenting after separation/ divorce</h2>



<p>It is important for separated or divorced couples to prioritise co-parenting for their child&#8217;s well-being. This means working together to make decisions in the child&#8217;s best interest, maintaining open and respectful communication, and ensuring that both parents remain involved in the child&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>Research has shown that children who have positive relationships with both of their parents after a<br>divorce or separation have better outcomes in terms of emotional well-being and academic performance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The role of BOTH parents is crucial</h2>



<p>In conclusion, the role of parents in children&#8217;s development is crucial, and the absence of one or both parents can have negative effects on children&#8217;s academic, emotional, and behavioural outcomes.</p>



<p>It is important for all families, whether together or apart, to prioritise healthy relationships between both mother and father figures. This means ensuring that both parents remain involved in their child&#8217;s life, even if they are no longer together. By doing so, we can help ensure that children have the best chance at a healthy and successful future. Society should prioritise and support families to ensure that children grow up in an environment that promotes their well-being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why parenting is a HUGE responsibility</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image52_4919f8-d4 size-full kb-image-is-ratio-size"><div class="kb-is-ratio-image kb-image-ratio-land43"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.childrenneedboth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/man-in-black-sweater-and-blue-denim.jpeg" alt="" class="kb-img wp-image-16"/></div></figure>



<p>Parenting is a challenging but rewarding experience that requires immense responsibility. As parents, it&#8217;s our duty to provide for and nurture our children while instilling values that will help them become successful adults. <br><br><strong>Here are some reasons why parental responsibility is crucial in raising successful children:</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Sets the Foundation for Life Skills</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Builds Self-Esteem</h2>



<p>Children who grow up with supportive parents tend to have higher self-esteem than those who don&#8217;t receive adequate support from their caregivers or feel neglected at home.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Encourages Academic Success</h2>



<p>Research has shown that parental involvement plays a vital role in academic achievement among students; hence taking an active interest in your child’s education can lead to better grades overall academic<br>performance resulting ultimately into greater opportunities later on like college admissions or job prospects down the line!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Fosters Emotional Intelligence</h2>



<p>Emotional intelligence refers to one&#8217;s ability to recognize emotions within themselves and others while regulating them effectively; this skillset comes from having healthy relationships modelled by responsible parenting practices helping kids develop these important social-emotional competencies early-on set them up well for future success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be a positive influence!</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Consideration is an essential aspect of any healthy and happy family relationship.</h2>



<p>In practical terms, consideration may involve simple acts such as listening attentively when someone<br>speaks to us or helping out with household chores without being asked. </p>



<p>It may also mean refraining from saying hurtful things during arguments or making compromises when conflicts arise.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Showing consideration requires <strong>empathy &#8211; the ability to put ourselves in another person&#8217;s shoes and<br>understand how they feel</strong>. Empathy allows us to respond appropriately to others&#8217; emotions by offering support or comfort when needed.</p>

<p>When parents, whether together or apart, prioritise showing each other respect through acts of kindness and understanding instead of focusing solely on individual wants, needs, and desires; it leads them towards healthier<br>communication patterns which further strengthen their bond over time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 specific ways in which consideration can be practiced:</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Listen &#8216;actively&#8217;</h2>



<p>When someone speaks to you, it is essential that you give them your full attention and actively listen to what<br>they have to say. This means avoiding distractions like phones or television. </p>



<p>Ask questions or clarify points if necessary.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Understand Boundaries</h2>



<p>Every member of the family has their own boundaries that need to be respected. </p>



<p>It is important not to overstep these boundaries by being too intrusive or demanding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Share and accept responsibilities</h2>



<p>Families work best when everyone pitches in with household chores and other responsibilities. </p>



<p>By sharing tasks, we show consideration for each other&#8217;s time and energy levels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Avoid hurtful words:</h2>



<p>During arguments or disagreements, it can be easy to lash out with hurtful words that we later regret saying.</p>



<p>Instead of attacking each other verbally, focus on finding solutions together while respecting each others&#8217; opinions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Making Time For Each Other</h2>



<p>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world where everyone seems busy all the time; making an effort towards spending quality time with your loved ones goes a long way in showing how much you value them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Practice empathy &#8211; Put yourself in their shoes </h2>



<p>Practicing consideration within families leads towards healthier relationships, mutual respect &amp; understanding between members by prioritising one another&#8217;s well-being above individual wants, needs, or desires. </p>



<p>It requires empathy &#8211; putting oneself into another person’s shoes &#8211; active listening skills ,understanding boundaries ,sharing responsibilities ,avoiding hurtful words during conflicts &amp; making conscious efforts towards spending quality time together as a unit!</p>
